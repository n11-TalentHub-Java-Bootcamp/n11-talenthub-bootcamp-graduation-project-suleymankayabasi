## Usage

### Description
There are prerequisites for the customer to apply for a loan. These are ID number, name-surname, monthly income, telephone number, date of birth and collateral amount.
The customer's credit score is calculated based on the last digit of the identification number.
After the customer makes an application, the customer's information is sent to the credit service, and the customer's credit status and limit are calculated.
Finally, the notification service notifies the customer of the credit status to the user by sms.
In addition, new users can be defined in the system, existing customers can be updated or deleted.
A completed loan application can only be queried with the ID number and date of birth.

## Application User Interface

I chose React and Tailwind Css for the frontend of my project because In my opinion, they can help me. 
I needed a total of 6 pages for the requirements of the project and I provided the communication between the pages with routers. 
There is no validation control on the frontend. Therefore, care should be taken when entering data.
Finally, if you send an incorrect request, you will receive a warning message. If you send correct request,you will receive a approval message.

## Main Page

There are 2 different buttons on the main page. The application form button is for application procedures. The second button is for post-application processes.

After clicking the application form button, you will come to the application screen. On this screen, the customer's information is obtained and an application is created by clicking the last application button. 

!!Reminding!! Data should be entered as in the picture.

You should click the second button to learn the process of updating and deleting the user or the application result.
